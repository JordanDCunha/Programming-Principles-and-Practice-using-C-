/**
 * SECTION 6.1: INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARE EVOLUTION
 * --- THEORY PART ---
 * [1] THE HALFWAY POINT: 
 * A program that "basically works" is just a prototype. Professional 
 * programming requires making the code reliable and user-friendly.
 * [2] THE EXPERIMENTATION PHASE: 
 * Now that we have a stable base (the parser from Ch 5), we can test 
 * how the program handles weird inputs or how hard it is to add features.
 * [3] REFINEMENT: 
 * Real software evolves. We don't just write it once; we improve it 
 * under the "pressure of requirements" (what the user needs).

// We start Chapter 6 with the code from 5.9.
